# Making devices talk to each other

Microscopes are complex systems with significant electro-mechanical features and separate parts need to communicate with each other.

Cameras, stages, light sources, and other devices need to be activated or switched from one mode to another at an appropriate time, for example to achieve multi-color imaging or time-locked stimulation in animal experiments.

Devices usually can receive and send signals using voltage levels: for example, if voltage is 5V it is considered "HIGH" or "1".
