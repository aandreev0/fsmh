# How can we generate signals?


## Voltage levels and TTL

## Receiving signals from devices
- Impedance and current sinking/sourcing
- Logic levels and tolerances


# Implementation with Arduino

## Creating simple logic with Arduino
- when X, do Y
- counting frames
- driving LEDs

## Advanced details
- Interrupts
- Digital-to-analog converters
- Real-time data processing
- Serial port communications

# DAQ (NI DAQs)

More advanced technology for generating fast, predictable signals with option for feedback loops is using Data Acquisition (DAQ) platform such as National Instrument devices (currently "gold standard") or very similar Advantech iDAQ (at lower price point). Here we discuss several specific example of using DAQ for driving microscope operations. 

# Function generators

# Sensors: temperature, humidity, flow
