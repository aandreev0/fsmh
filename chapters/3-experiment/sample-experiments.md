# Sample experiments



## Structural single-cell imaging



## Calcium imaging

Calcium imaging is time-lapse experiment in 2D or 3D where primary goal is to analyze changes in calcium levels in the tissue of interest. Modern calcium indicators are engineered using fluorescent proteins such as [GCaMP](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05828-9) or FRET-based sensor such as [Twitch-GR](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02452-z)

We have [previously published](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2021/04/12/a-biologists-checklist-for-calcium-imaging-and-optogenetic-analysis/) recommendations on running these experiments and here present and example.
