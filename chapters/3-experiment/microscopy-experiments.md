# Designing microscopy experiments

When considering microscopy imaging as a tool to uncover new biology or verify another experiment or test a hypothesis, the first question we always have to ask is:

*What is that you are trying to see?*

That simple question requires specificity and microscopy professionals will appreciate if you can come up with concrete details. That include:

- how small are objects that you care about?
- what is the environment for these objects: other cells, gel, water, lipids?
- what is the field of view / how sparse are these objects?
- are they moving and if so, how fast, or more specifically what amount of movement you care about and what can be ignored
- how are the objects labeled / how can we tell them from other objects (shape? fluorescent marker? intrinsic reflectance?)
- do you need to use sample after the imaging is done?

For each specific type of experiment we might ask more questions. For example for optogenetics and calcium imaging experiments we have come up with example questions [here](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2021/04/12/a-biologists-checklist-for-calcium-imaging-and-optogenetic-analysis/)

## What are you trying to see?

## Picking the right technique

## Considering limitation and pyramid of trade-offs
