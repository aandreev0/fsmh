# Why we care about fluorescence phenomena

Fluorescence is a phenomenon of light emission after absorption of photon (irradiation). Unlike phosphorescence, that can last after excitation ended, fluorescence rapidly ceases after absorption of irradiation.

Fluorescence happens usually within visible range of wavelengths, 400-600nm.
