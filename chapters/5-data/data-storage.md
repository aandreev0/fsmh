# Data storage problem

Microscopy experiments can generate significant amount of data that needs to be archived and preserved often for years. Sometimes it takes long time to process the data, or to collect the whole datasets, and even longer to prepare data for publication. Re-analysis often required in the process of writing the research paper or addressing the review process. Even modest datasets can occupy 100s of gigabytes. We have discussed data storage previously, mainly focussing on three solutions:

- cloud-based data storage
- local, server-based solutions
- institute data storage

## Local storage

## Cloud is someone else's computer

## Data compression
