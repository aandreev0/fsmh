# Presentation of microscopy data



## Colormaps

Colormaps are tools for converting numbers into pixels of specific color and intensity on the screen (or print) for human viewing. Some colormaps are better than other for human vision and screen/projector presentation, and picking best colormap depends on the way it will be viewed. In microscopy [we have long-going discussions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4959790/) about best colormaps, and universally accepted "bad" colormaps (such as [terrible](https://x.com/Red_Green_Cow) *default* red/green/blue). [Good-enough colormaps](https://x.com/aandr314/status/1552748112262807552) include Grayscale, Hot, Fire, and CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/key-black). Some colormaps are optimized for helping people with [decreased color sensitivity / color-blindness](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mra.00795-22). Picking the colormap might allow your listeners/readers to appreciate your effort or make them upset and angry that they can't see anything:

Here we compare Green colormap with Hot colormap on the same dataset with the same range of intensities:
