# Detecting optical signals

Light detectors converting incoming photons into electrical signals that can be digitized to produce images.


## Single-pixel detectors

Laser-scanning microscopy (confocal, two-photon, near-field super-resolution and other types) relies on point detectors for high sensitivity and low-noise detection. Commonly we use PMT and GaAsP detectors and move the sample or position of illuminated point to achieve 2D imaging.

## Camera-based sensors

2D sensors combine multiple pixels to detect light coming from various points within field of view. Currently sCMOS technology is prevalent for scientific imaging.

## Spectral detection

Both single-pixel detectors and cameras can be used to acquire spectral information from the sample. To achieve fast, one-shot acquisition linear detectors are often used where spectral information is spread across multiple pixels. [When using 2D sensors](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8990), data can be multiplexed to acquire spatial and spectral information at the same time.
