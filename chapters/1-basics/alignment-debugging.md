# Alignment and debugging the microscope

Microscopes are complex systems comprising hardware and software elements. Optimal performance depends on precise settings, hardware alignment, correct electronic connections and signals. All of these elements can change with time due to various reasons:

## Common sources of issues

- reversible changes in software: change in imaging settings
- reversible changes in hardware: change of filter sets; light sources; disconnection of cables; devices turned off/capped; shutters closed
- permanent changes in hardware: laser aging; [light damage to mirrors](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=9025&tabname=Damage%20Thresholds); damage to electronics (DAQ channels); [damage to sensors](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/optical-engineering/volume-56/issue-3/034108/Laser-induced-damage-threshold-of-camera-sensors-and-micro-optoelectromechanical/10.1117/1.OE.56.3.034108.full); [physical damage to detection objective or dirt](https://x.com/Nat_Prunet/status/1631747764320174081)
- permanent changes in software: backwards-incompatible software update; filled-up storage space; network connectivity issues
- drift in hardware: vibrations, metal/glass expansion due to [temperature changes](https://x.com/JLazzariDean/status/1567680867002363905), [HVAC performance](http://dx.doi.org/10.7517/issn.1674-0475.180303)
