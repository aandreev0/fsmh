### Optical adapters

Optical systems often involves different interfaces, specifically different types of threads on parts. To overcome this incompatibility, we can often purchase adapters (see [Thorlabs thread adapters](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_id=2327) page for many examples). However, sometimes needed components don't exist or have wrong dimensions.

To overcome this issue, we can use CNC machining or 3D printing to generate custom adapters, or create "join" parts that can connect commercially-available adapters to create new adapters.
