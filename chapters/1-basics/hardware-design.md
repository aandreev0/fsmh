# Hardware design for microscopy



## Assembling from parts

## Making custom parts
- 3D Printing
- CNC
- Getting your parts manufactured
- laser cutting

## Examples of projects

### Sample holders


### Optical adapters

Optical systems often involves different interfaces, specifically different types of threads on parts. To overcome this incompatibility, we can often purchase adapters (see [Thorlabs thread adapters](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_id=2327) page for many examples). However, sometimes needed components don't exist or have wrong dimensions.

To overcome this issue, we can use CNC machining or 3D printing to generate custom adapters, or create "join" parts that can connect commercially-available adapters to create new adapters.

### Embedded systems

Part of microscopy systems or the whole imaging setups can be assembled on a custom base to achieve portability and rigidity, or uniformity of the components. Such embedded systems combine custom and off-the-shelf parts, often with custom adapters and mounting hardware to make strong and reliable hardware system. One example is [Flamingo light-sheet microscope](https://huiskenlab.com/flamingo/):
