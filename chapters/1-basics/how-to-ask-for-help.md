# How to find more help

Microscopy is a very technical field that combined wide range of topics (hence this *handbook*).

It is necessary to seek additional help, assistances, or clarifications when planning experiments, thinking about new setups, acquiring data for the first time, or just trying to understand how particular experiment is done and what limitations it might have.

Nobody knows everything and sharing within microscopy community is part of culture. However, one need to know how to efficiently seek assistance and how to make sure your colleagues will be glad answer your questions in the future.

Apart from community support (online forums or blogs) you can get a lot of information from studying knowledge bases supported by companies. These resources often provide clear information, discuss limitations, and often offer particular off-the-shelf solutions. Importantly, the list below doesn't include any marketing materials.
