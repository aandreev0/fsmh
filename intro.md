# Full-Stack Microscopy Handbook

Biology experiment and biomedical R&D requires understanding of science, hardware, and engineering.
Full-stack microscopy provides practical review of design & implementation across whole structure of projects: from envisioning experimental setups to programming control and data analysis

This handbook is designed to be a general reference to a wide range of topics, potentially missing a lot of details. Where possible, we provide specific references where you can learn more; in other cases we would recommend asking for assistance more knowledgeable colleagues both online and offline.
